# PGIYOL - The *Passphrase Generator In Your Own Language*

This little Python script will help you with creating passphrases in your own language.

But since this is still in environment and not really productive at the moment, I don't recommend using it, until I have a few more language and everything working as it should. :)

At the moment only german is available and with a not really curated passphrase list.

This is a project for my #100DaysOfCode Challenge. If you're interested in what this is, [you should go to the website https://www.100daysofcode.com/](https://www.100daysofcode.com/)
